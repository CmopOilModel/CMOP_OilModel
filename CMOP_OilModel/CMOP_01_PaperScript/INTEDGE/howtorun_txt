      d-output_check : a previous experiment to check the results
      
     
/   how to run
    ---------- 
     
    1. confirm you are inside the folder GRIDS
    
    2. edit
       run_intedge.scpt
       
       and type the values for 
       
         TIME_STOP      : time in HOURS for the integation.
         DT             : time step in SECONDS
         TIME_PRINT_INC : time between 2 output in HOURS         
      
    3. type 
       run_intedge.scpt
       
       in the end of the simulation, the Time used by the computer is 
       displaying, eg
       
         Time =          1.87442 seconds.
 
    4. check the files generated/storage
       ls d-output 
         
         intedge_input  : times choosed by the user
         reporter_txt   : each line corresponds to an output according to 
           the value TIME_PRINT_INC
         TEV_LOCATION.DAT : binary file with the time evolution of all 
           locations particles 
                        
         history_parcel_01_txt : location of particle number 1 every 
           time step

   This repository contains benchmarks for two types of tools
   frequently employed in particle tracking algorithms:
   
   > in-cell test : to check if a position is in a cell,
     
   > next-cell test : to find the next cell in a sequence until reaching 
     the target cell, where the particle is contained.
     
   Both tests are adapted and applied in algorithms with partitioned 
   time-step, namely 
   
   > OutEdge : the particle can move behoynd the current cell,
   
   > IntEdge : the particle is intercepted in the edge of the current 
               cell
               
   A detailed description of these algorithms is provided in the manus

   interval" by Luciana de Freitas Tessarolo, Valdir Innocentini,

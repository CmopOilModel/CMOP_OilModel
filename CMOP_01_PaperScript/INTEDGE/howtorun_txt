      d-output_check : a previous experiment to check the results
      
     
/   how to run
    ---------- 
     
    1. confirm you are inside the folder INTEDGE
    
    
    2. confirm there exist the files 
    
         ../GRID/GRD_CELL_NODES.DAT  
         ../GRID/GRD_NODES_LOCATION.DAT 
         ../GRID/GRD_GRID_AROUND.DAT   
         ../GRID/GRD_VEC_AROUND.DAT  
         
       If not, type
         cd ../GRIDS 
       and follow the txt there. 
    
    
    3. edit
       run_intedge.scpt
       
       and type in the lines 8-10 the values for 
       
         TIME_STOP      : time in HOURS for the integation.
         DT             : time step in SECONDS
         TIME_PRINT_INC : time between 2 output in HOURS      
         
       The previous tested case use values in the file 
         d-output_check/intedge_input  
      
    4. type 
       run_intedge.scpt
       
       in the end of the simulation, the Time used by the computer is 
       displaying, eg
       
         Time =          1.87442 seconds.
 
    5. check the files generated/storage
       ls d-output 
         
         intedge_input  : times choosed by the user
         reporter_txt   : each line corresponds to an output according to 
           the value TIME_PRINT_INC
         TEV_LOCATION.DAT : binary file with the time evolution of all 
           locations particles 
                        
         history_parcel_01_txt : location of particle number 1 every 
           time step 
  
                   
 /   important notes
     ---------------
     
     > in the code 'run_intedge.f90' 
     
       - line 70--- the command
       
           CALL SYSTEM ( " cat  LOCATION.DAT_RELEASE.... 
         
         releases a group of 97 particles. If more releases is necessary,
         repeat this line. For example, nine CALL correspond to  9x97
         releases.

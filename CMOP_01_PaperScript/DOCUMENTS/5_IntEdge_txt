    Overview
    --------      
      The algorithm for tracing the trajectory by shifting the parcel in
      smaller displacements, each one until reaching the edge of the 
      currente cell, is called IntEdge.
      
      The time step is divided into smaller values, and the velocity in 
      the intersected cell is used to calculate the new displacement 
      until it intersects the edge of the new cell. The process 
      continues until the time step is complete.
          
    How to run
    ----------
      Go to the folder INTEDGE and follow the instructions in

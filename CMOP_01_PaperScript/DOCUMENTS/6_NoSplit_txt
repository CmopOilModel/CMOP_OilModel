    Overview
    --------      
      In NoSplit algorithm, the time step split employed in the IntEdge 
      algorithm is turned off, that is, the sequence of cells traced 
      from the initial position to the final one is obtained directly, 
      without recalculating the velocity. The sequence of cells runs in 
      a straight line between the two positions.

    Overview
    --------    
      In this folder, the files needed to run the experiments on an 
      unstructured grid are generated. The grid defined here has 
      constant spacing between nodes, that is, it is a regular grid, but 
      the files are generated for an unstructured grid, and the 
      experiments are performed as if the grid were unstructured.
      
      The grid has 4000X100 nodes, and the forcing current is high on 
      the left side of the grid, and very low in the right side.
